A programming language is a computer language coders use to develop software programs, scripts, or other instructions for computers to execute. Many languages share similarities; however, each has its syntax. Once a programmer familiarizes with the languageâ€™s rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in IDE (integrated development environment) or a text editor. Later, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that the computer can understand.
